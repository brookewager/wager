        <h3>The Mastiff</h3>
        <p>Leo is my oldest dog! He is very big and sort of scary looking but I promise he is really sweet. He likes to sit on your lap because it's more comfortable for him than sitting on the floor, and he has no idea that he's heavy. We got him after our dog, Duke, passed over the rainbow bridge. When we got him, we thought he would be half lab and half labrador retriever. He actually ended up being 75% mastiff, and only 25% lab, which is why he's 160 pounds. The only way we can tell that he's even part lab is because he absolutely loves water and he has webbed feet! Whenever you turn the outdoor hose on, he sticks his face in it to drink. Leo also cries a lot to communicate with us. It doesn't matter if you've been gone 10 minutes or 10 weeks, you can count on Leo to cry when you get home. He also loves to sleep in bed since that's where he fits best. </p>

        <h3>The Calico Cat</h3>
        <p>Maybe is 16 years old. She's been overweight and food obsessed her whole life, and we got her when she was just a tiny kitten. My family always wanted a cat and we ended up getting Maybe from a Craigslist ad. A woman near us had a pregnant mom come to her barn and give birth to a whole litter of kittens, and she was giving out the kittens for free! The funniest part of Maybe's story is where her name comes from. My oldest brother, Nicholas, is allergic to both dogs and cats. My parents found out a few years prior when they brought home a black kitten who they loved dearly, but they found Nicholas in the bathroom with ice cubes on his eyes, crying because he knew he was allergic but didn't want the rest of us to know. My parents gave that cat to a family friend, but we ended up discovering that white, female, spayed cats are the most hypoallergenic cat that you can have. So, when we got Maybe, we weren't sure if she was going to stay with us since it depended on the severity of my brothers allergies, her name meaning "maybe she stays, maybe she goes." And, here we are 16 years later and she's still going strong and I love her so so much. </p>

      <h3>The Mutt Mutt</h3>
      <p>Tito is the youngest of everyone! After we got Leo, I told my parents that our next dog had to be from a rescue. So, I went on a search and found Tito, who at that time was known as 'Snickers'! I saw her on a Pennysylvania rescue website, so I reached out and they connected us with her foster mom. They required a meet and greet before adoption, so we met with her foster mom, who informed us that there was another family also coming to meet her and that they would make a decision once they met us both and saw us both interect with her. Of course we had Leo at this time, so the meet and greet was mainly for him. They got along so well, and they had matching brindle fur so we were really hoping that the foster family would pick us. And they did! She's so sweet and everything you could want in a dog. She loves to cuddle, play, and wear t-shirts. She's also obsessed with Leo, and they both have severe attatchment issues. Seriously, you can't take one someplace without the other one freaking out. We got her a DNA test and she's mostly pitbull but has some Great Pyrenees and Sheperd mix!</p>
